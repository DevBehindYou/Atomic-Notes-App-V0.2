/// Reads the in-app notification feed and tracks per-user read/dismiss state.

/// MIGRATION NOTE: notifications were explicitly out of scope for this
/// migration pass (see the server's README — the notifications_feed/
/// notification_mark_read/notification_mark_all_read/notification_dismiss
/// RPCs exist in the live app but have no server-side home yet). Rather than
/// leave this referencing a Supabase client that no longer exists (a compile
/// error) or silently pretending to call a working feed, every network path
/// below is stubbed to a safe no-op: the feed loads empty, and
/// mark-read/dismiss just no-op locally. `unreadCount` therefore reads 0
/// everywhere it's shown, which is honest given there is nothing behind it
/// yet — not a bug to chase if you see it.
